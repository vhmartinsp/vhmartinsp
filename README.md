Hello everyone!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Victor Hugo, a professional passionate about technology, communication and the positive impact that the union of these two elements can generate for the people and communities around me.
Since I was a child, I had a deep connection with technology, which led me to learn to program in high school. However, my curiosity pushed me to see technology through a more human perspective, which led me to choose to study Public Relations in higher education.
Throughout my academic journey at Unesp, as a Public Relations undergraduate, I developed a unique ability to dynamically analyze the needs of different target audiences and improve my ability to communicate assertively. I realized the value of connecting people and ideas to build solid and lasting relationships.
My background in data analytics has brought an enriching perspective to my strategic approach. Utilizing my communication skills and understanding of stakeholders, I found a unique advantage in interpreting and communicating the insights extracted from data.
Throughout this journey, I have acquired critical and technical analysis skills, enabling me to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for improvement aligned to the organization's strategic objectives.
I constantly look for innovation and challenges to excel. In this space, I share projects and contributions that reflect my enthusiasm for technology, data visualization skills, advanced knowledge in SQL, and my continuous learning in Python.
My goal is to grow together with the GitHub community, contributing to collaborative projects and becoming an active part of technological advancement in search of innovative solutions.

I am excited to continue this journey and build an increasingly human technological future, connecting ideas and creating positive changes for our societies.
